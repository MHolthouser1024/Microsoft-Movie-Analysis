    "I have been tasked with helping Microsoft in their new business venture into the movie industry. I think it is important to look at not only genres and release date, but also which actors and directors were voted the most popular.  After exploring the data, it seems that audiences really prefer movies of the action, adventure, science fiction genre, which makes sense with the recent surge of super hero movies. Although actors and directors are considered a soft data point and can't be described with a hard number, they are key to attracting the avid movie goers to come watch your film. I will also provide data and visualizations to show when the best time of year to release a film, profitable genres, and popular directors and actors. This analysis will ultimately provide the components that generate successful movies."

    "It appears that the top worldwide grossing month to release a film since 2010 is in the month of November. My intial thoughts before I began the analysis, was that the best month to release a film was going to be around Christmas time. But after more analysis, it appears that the summer time is just as profitable as the Christmas holidays. June, December, and May come in fairly even with each other. The worst month to release a film is clearly in the month of January, so don't release a movie during the new year. "

From the data provided, hiring well known directors and actors is proven to positively impact the worldwide gross for a film. To promote the highest box office sales, I recommend a release date during the summer season or during the holidays in November and December. \n",
    "Movie genre, the hiring of a director and lead actor, and release month are all factors critical to creating a successul film. "
